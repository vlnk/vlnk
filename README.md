# 🤙🏻 About myself

I have studied in computer engineering because I find a great interest in development creativity and computing projects. I lead a small personal watch about new techniques of programming and software innovation. In addition of a fond fascination of the independent cinema and the electronic music, I contribute to a development team during my free time and I try to do my best for making music and video. As far as I have a good health (and I do all to maintain it), I am motivated, a little bit perfectionist and a very bad joker.

# ‍💻 Past experiences


## **Lead Front-End Developer** at [The Society for Arts and Technology](https://sat.qc.ca/)

-   I developed *from scratch* the new version of the [Scenic](https://gitlab.com/sat-mtl/tools/scenic/scenic) interface that is contributing to [the telepresence ecosystem](https://telepresence-scenic.ca/). Also, I contributed to its back-end called [`Switcher`](https://gitlab.com/sat-mtl/tools/switcher) and I developped library of [`UI Components`](https://gitlab.com/sat-mtl/tools/ui-components) for all the web Front-End developed at the SAT.
-   I leaded the development team at the Valorisation department in order to provide the future of the telepresence tools. In addition, I was **Co-Director** in interim of the departement during few months.


## **Front-End Developer** at [Trisotech](https://www.trisotech.com/)

-   I help the development of new features on their [**Digital Modeling Suite**](https://www.trisotech.com/digital-modeling-suite/) by developing some Front-End parts with [`jQuery`](https://jquery.com/) and Back-End parts with **Java**.


## **Developer** at [Butor](http://www.butor.com)

-   I learned a lot by documenting all the open-sourced `Javascript` source with [`JSDoc`](https://jsdoc.app/) and by improving and analysing the `Java` back-end with my [UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/) knowledge.


## **Developer Intern** at [Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/)

-   I experimented [MVVM patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/mvvm) with a data viewer written in [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp).


# 📈 Technology levels

I enumerate all tools I worked with in profesionnal contexts but as I am very curious in all kinds of technologies I am am very motivated to discover and master new tools. I have a strong capacity of **adaptation**.


## Expert

-   🕸 Web ecosystem with [`Javascript`](https://www.javascript.com/), [`HTML`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) and [`CSS`](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) languages including [`React`](https://reactjs.org/), [`NodeJS`](https://nodejs.org) and [`Webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) frameworks.
-   🐋 [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com/) tooling suite in order to isolate all software environments.
-   🚀 [`Gitlab`](https://about.gitlab.com/) environment with the **Continuous Integration** concept in order to deliver my new developments quickly in an **agility** context.


## Mastering

-   🐧 [`Linux`](https://kernel.org/) environment as I know a lot of tools in order to be eficient on such systems. I like scripting my stuff with [`Bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) when I feel it will improve my developer life and I can adapt this experience for [`MacOS`](https://www.apple.com/ca/macos) systems.
-   🐍 I am mastering the [`Python`](https://www.python.org/) language in a lot of contexts: I am developing with my team a [`Socket.IO`](https://socket.io/) back-end with it and I am often scripting with it for my personal projects.


## Intermediate

-   🤖 I use and approve [the `C` and `C++`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) code in my day-to-day at SAT.
-   ☄ [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/) and [`C#`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) environments as I used to work with them during my past experiences.


## Autodidact

-   🐄 [`GNU Emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is my favorite text editor and I use the [`org-mode`](https://orgmode.org/) tool for all my projects. <span class="underline">Don't be afraid</span>, I can also use [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [`Android Studio`](https://developer.android.com/studio/) if the situation needs it.
-   🦀 I developped some personnal projects with [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and I am very interested by digging deeper in developments with this language.
-   🌺 The functionnal languages are my secret developer's hobby such as [`Closure Script`](https://clojurescript.org/) and [`Scheme`](http://www.call-cc.org/).
-   🏗 [`NixOS`](https://nixos.org/) is currently installed on my laptop and I developped a lot of tricks with its environment in order to increase my day-to-day productivity.
