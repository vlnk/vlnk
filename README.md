# 🤙🏻 About myself

I have studied in computer engineering because I find a great interest in development creativity and computing projects. I lead a small personal watch about new techniques of programming and software innovation. In addition of a fond fascination of the independent cinema and the electronic music, I contribute to a development team during my free time and I try to do my best for making music and video. As far as I have a good health (and I do all to maintain it), I am motivated, a little bit perfectionist and a very bad joker.

-   **Ingénieur diplômé** at the Public Engineering School in Computer Science (France)

# 📈 Technology levels

I enumerate all tools I worked with in profesionnal contexts but as I am very curious in all kinds of technologies I am am very motivated to discover and master new tools. I have a strong capacity of **adaptation**.


## Expert

-   🕸 Web ecosystem with `Javascript`, `HTML` and `CSS` languages including `React`, `NodeJS` and `Webpack` frameworks.
-   🐋 `Docker` tooling suite in order to isolate all software environments.
-   🚀 `Gitlab` environment with the **Continuous Integration** concept in order to deliver my new developments quickly in an **agility** context.


## Mastering

-   🐧 `Linux` environment as I know a lot of tools in order to be eficient on such systems. I like scripting my stuff with `Bash` when I feel it will improve my developer life and I can adapt this experience for `MacOS` systems.
-   🐍 I am mastering the `Python` language in a lot of contexts: I am developing with my team a `Socket.IO` back-end with it and I am often scripting with it for my personal projects.


## Intermediate

-   🤖 I use and approve [the `C` and `C++`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) code in my day-to-day at SAT.
-   ☄ [`Java`](https://www.java.com/en/) and [`C#`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) environments as I used to work with them during my past experiences.


## Autodidact

-   🐄 [`GNU Emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is my favorite text editor and I use the [`org-mode`](https://orgmode.org/) tool for all my projects. <span class="underline">Don't be afraid</span>, I can also use [`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [`Android Studio`](https://developer.android.com/studio/) if the situation needs it.
-   🦀 I developped some personnal projects with [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and I am very interested by digging deeper in developments with this language.
-   🌺 The functionnal languages are my secret developer's hobby such as [`Closure Script`](https://clojurescript.org/) and [`Scheme`](http://www.call-cc.org/).
-   🏗 [`NixOS`](https://nixos.org/) is currently installed on my laptop and I developped a lot of tricks with its environment in order to increase my day-to-day productivity.
