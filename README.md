#### 🤙🏻 About myself

I have studied in computer engineering because I find a great interest in development creativity and computing projects. I lead a small personal watch about new techniques of programming and software innovation. In addition of a fond fascination of the independent cinema and the electronic music, I contribute to a development team during my free time and I try to do my best for making music and video. As far as I have a good health (and I do all to maintain it), I am motivated, a little bit perfectionist and a very bad joker.
