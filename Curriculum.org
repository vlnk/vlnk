* 🤙🏻 About myself
I have studied in computer engineering because I find a great interest in development creativity and computing projects. I lead a small personal watch about new techniques of programming and software innovation. In addition of a fond fascination of the independent cinema and the electronic music, I contribute to a development team during my free time and I try to do my best for making music and video. As far as I have a good health (and I do all to maintain it), I am motivated, a little bit perfectionist and a very bad joker.

* 🏫 Diplomas
- *Master's Degree in Computing* at the University of Québec in Chicoutimi (Canada)
- *Ingénieur diplômé* at the Public Engineering School in Computer Science (France)

* 👨‍💻 Past experiences

- I developed /from scratch/ the new version of the Scenic interface that is contributing to the telepresence ecosystem. Also, I contributed to its back-end called *Switcher* and I developped a *UI Component* library for all the web Front-End developed at the SAT.
- I leaded the development team at the Valorisation department in order to provide the future of the telepresence tools. In addition, I was *Co-Director* in interim of the departement during few months.
** *Front-End Developer* at Trisotech
- I help the development of new features on their *Digital Modeling Suite* by developing some Front-End parts with *jQuery* and Back-End parts with *Java*.
** *Developer* at Butor
** *Developer Intern* at Infineon

* 📈 Technology levels
I enumerate all tools I worked with in profesionnal contexts but as I am very curious in all kinds of technologies I am am very motivated to discover and master new tools. I have a strong capacity of *adaptation*.
** Expert
- 🕸 Web ecosystem with ~Javascript~, ~HTML~ and ~CSS~ languages including ~React~, ~NodeJS~ and ~Webpack~ frameworks.
- 🐋 ~Docker~ tooling suite in order to isolate all software environments.
- 🚀 ~Gitlab~ environment with the *Continuous Integration* concept in order to deliver my new developments quickly in an *agility* context.
** Mastering
- 🐧 ~Linux~ environment as I know a lot of tools in order to be eficient on such systems. I like scripting my stuff with ~Bash~ when I feel it will improve my developer life and I can adapt this experience for ~MacOS~ systems.
- 🐍 I am mastering the ~Python~ language in a lot of contexts: I am developing with my team a ~Socket.IO~ back-end with it and I am often scripting with it for my personal projects.
** Intermediate
- 🤖 I use and approve [[https://en.cppreference.com/w/][the ~C~ and ~C++~]] code in my day-to-day at SAT.
- ☄ [[https://www.java.com/en/][~Java~]] and [[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/][~C#~]] environments as I used to work with them during my past experiences.
** Autodidact
- 🐄 [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][~GNU Emacs~]] is my favorite text editor and I use the [[https://orgmode.org/][~org-mode~]] tool for all my projects. _Don't be afraid_, I can also use [[https://code.visualstudio.com/][~Visual Studio Code~]] or [[https://developer.android.com/studio/][~Android Studio~]] if the situation needs it.
- 🦀 I developped some personnal projects with [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][~Rust~]] and I am very interested by digging deeper in developments with this language.
- 🌺 The functionnal languages are my secret developer's hobby such as [[https://clojurescript.org/][~Closure Script~]] and [[http://www.call-cc.org/][~Scheme~]].
- 🏗 [[https://nixos.org/][~NixOS~]] is currently installed on my laptop and I developped a lot of tricks with its environment in order to increase my day-to-day productivity.
